Based on Brandon T. Elliott's script on: https://brandon-t-elliott.github.io/conspiracy-nut

The batch files use the binary here: https://github.com/jin-stuff/foremost
I used ff3.bash to extract the .dmp files for firefox.exe and then the f4w.bat to extract the images from the .dmp using foremost in windows.

TODO:
Get Foremost to work in cygwin.
Get the bash script to work on my ubuntuu VM.
Test F4W.bat fully!
